                                Halloween might be known today for costumes, candy, and spooky decorations, but its
                                story
                                stretches back over 2,000 years to the Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in).
                                Long
                                before carved pumpkins and trick-or-treating, Samhain marked the end of the harvest
                                season
                                and
                                the beginning of winter — a time when people believed the line between the living and
                                the
                                dead
                                grew thin.
                                The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, the UK, and northern France, celebrated
                                Samhain
                                around November 1. They believed that on the night before, spirits could cross over into
                                the
                                world of the living. To protect themselves, people lit large bonfires, made offerings to
                                their
                                gods, and wore disguises — often animal skins or masks — to trick wandering spirits into
                                leaving
                                them alone. These early costumes were meant not for fun, but for safety and respect
                                toward
                                supernatural forces.

                                What makes dim sum so special is the way it brings people together. Families gather on
                                weekends,
                                often filling large round tables with friends, grandparents, and children. There is
                                something
                                deeply communal about passing dishes, sharing stories, and choosing your favorites from
                                rolling
                                carts filled with steaming dumplings, buns, and pastries. You might reach for a shrimp
                                dumpling,
                                a bite of siu mai, or a fluffy char siu bao, but the real magic is in the shared
                                experience.
                                It
                                is food designed for connection, the kind that fills both your stomach and your soul.

                                Food played a big part in the festival too. After the harvest, people gathered to feast
                                and
                                give
                                thanks for the crops that would sustain them through winter. Offerings of food and drink
                                were
                                also left outside homes to please wandering spirits and ancestors. These customs laid
                                the
                                foundation for many Halloween traditions we know today, from dressing up to sharing
                                treats.
                                As Christianity spread through Europe, the church adapted many pagan festivals into its
                                own
                                calendar. Around the 8th century, Pope Gregory III established November 1 as All Saints’
                                Day,
                                also known as All Hallows’ Day, to honor saints and martyrs. The night before became
                                known
                                as
                                All Hallows’ Eve — which, over time, shortened to “Halloween.” Despite the new religious
                                meaning, many of the old Samhain customs continued, blending ancient folklore with
                                Christian
                                practices.

                                The tradition of trick-or-treating can also be traced back to medieval times. On All
                                Hallows’
                                Eve, poor families and children in parts of Britain and Ireland practiced “souling,”
                                where
                                they
                                went door-to-door offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food or coins. Later, in
                                Scotland and Ireland, children took part in “guising,” dressing up in costumes and
                                performing
                                songs or jokes for treats. When Irish and Scottish immigrants brought these customs to
                                North
                                America in the 19th century, they evolved into the modern practice of trick-or-treating.
                                By the 20th century, Halloween in North America had become a fun, community-centered
                                holiday
                                —
                                focused less on spirits and more on celebration. Candy companies saw an opportunity, and
                                by
                                the
                                1950s, handing out sweets had become the main event. Pumpkins replaced turnips for
                                carving
                                lanterns, inspired by the old Irish legend of “Stingy Jack,” and costume parties became
                                a
                                tradition for both kids and adults.
                                Today, Halloween is a blend of ancient superstition, cultural adaptation, and modern
                                creativity.
                                From spooky ghost stories to endless candy varieties, it connects us to centuries of
                                history
                                while celebrating imagination and community. Whether you’re scaring ghosts, sharing
                                sweets,
                                or
                                carving a pumpkin, you’re keeping the spirit of Samhain alive — in your own deliciously
                                fun
                                way.
